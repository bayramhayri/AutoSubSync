âœ¨ **AutoSubSync has been completely redesigned and rebuilt from scratch with the PyQt6 framework, bringing you a modern interface and a smoother, better user experience!**

Key changes:
- Added a new tool: [autosubsync](https://github.com/oseiskar/autosubsync)
- ffsubsync now runs at the module level instead of as an external executable, improving integration and performance.

There are too many improvements and fixes to list here.

**Full changelog:** https://github.com/denizsafak/AutoSubSync/compare/v6.0...v5.8

> I haven't tested the macOS build. Please open an issue if you encounter any problems.
