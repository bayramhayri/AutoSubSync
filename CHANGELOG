- Added a 'Copy' option to the right-click menu in the log window, enabling users to copy the log content to their clipboard.

- During batch synchronization, pairs that failed are now assigned their original sequence numbers from the synchronization process, instead of being re-numbered from 1.
- Improvements in code and translations.
