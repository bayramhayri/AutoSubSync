## `Credits`
- Thanks to creators of [ffsubsync](https://github.com/smacke/ffsubsync), [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and others. The automatic subtitle syncing feature is possible because of ffsubsync. This is just a GUI application for Windows that makes the process a bit easier. At the beginning, it was just a manual subtitle syncing program. Now it can do both manual and automatic subtitle sync.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The automatic sync feature is not perfect. I recommend you to check the subtitle after syncing.

> [!NOTE]
