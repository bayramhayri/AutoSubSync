
Plan:
`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` comes embedded in [ffsubsync-bin](https://github.com/qwqcode/ffsubsync-bin). AutoSubSync also includes them, so there are duplicates. To save some filesize, I tried to create ffsubsync-bin that doesn't inclue ffmpeg binaries but didn't seem to work. It needs a fix.

Credits:
ffpmpeg_download.py and ffsubsync-bin is copied from [@qwqcode](https://github.com/qwqcode)'s [ffsubsync-bin](https://github.com/qwqcode/ffsubsync-bin)
