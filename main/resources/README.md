ffpmpeg_download.py and ffsubsync-bin is coming from [@qwqcode](https://github.com/qwqcode)'s [ffsubsync-bin](https://github.com/qwqcode/ffsubsync-bin). I reduced filesizes by removing unnecessary ffmpeg binaries from [ffsubsync-bin](https://github.com/qwqcode/ffsubsync-bin) using a custom [fork](https://github.com/denizsafak/ffsubsync-bin-core).
